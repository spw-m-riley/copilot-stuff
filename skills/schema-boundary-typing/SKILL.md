# Schema boundary typing

## Use this skill when

- The user wants runtime validation and static typing to agree at an API, storage, or parsing boundary.
- Untrusted input currently flows into application code with weak typing.
- The repository already uses a schema or validator library, or the boundary needs either a simple guard or a reusable schema pattern.

## Do not use this skill when

- The boundary is already validated elsewhere and the task is only to reuse an existing type.
- The task is mainly about internal domain modeling rather than input validation at the edge.

## Inputs to gather

**Required before editing**

- The untrusted boundary, such as request input, JSON parsing, or persisted records.
- Any existing schema or validator library already used by the repository.
- The expected validated shape and the code that consumes it.
- Error-handling expectations when validation fails.

**Helpful if present**

- Existing parsers, decoders, or helper wrappers around the same boundary.
- Tests for invalid payloads.
- Whether the validated type should be derived from the schema or mapped into a separate domain type.

## First move

1. Find the boundary where untrusted data first enters typed code.
2. Reuse the repository's existing schema or validator approach before adding anything new.
3. If no shared schema tool exists, decide whether a simple guard is enough or whether the boundary is important enough to justify a reusable schema pattern.
4. Define the validation close to the boundary, not deep inside consumers.

## Workflow

1. Model the external shape with the repository's existing schema or validator tool.
2. Parse or validate at the first boundary that can reject bad input cleanly.
3. When a simple guard is enough, keep the solution local and do not introduce a full schema dependency.
4. When a reusable schema exists or is justified, derive or expose the validated TypeScript type from it when the library supports that pattern.
5. Keep unvalidated data as `unknown` until it passes validation.
6. Map into a separate domain type only when the repository already distinguishes transport and domain models.
7. Update downstream consumers to rely on the validated type instead of re-checking ad hoc.

## Guardrails

- **Must not** claim a precise type for untrusted input without a matching runtime check.
- **Must not** introduce a new schema library when the repository already has a standard one or when a simple local guard is sufficient.
- **Should** validate once at the edge and pass the validated type inward.
- **Should** preserve existing error mapping and boundary behavior.
- **Should** prefer a simple local guard when the boundary is small, one-off, and unlikely to be shared.
- **May** keep a separate domain model when transport shapes and internal models differ materially.

## Routing boundary

- Route here from [`typescript-any-eliminator`](../typescript-any-eliminator/SKILL.md) when replacing `any` requires runtime boundary validation to make types truthful.
- After boundary types are stable, route compile-time contract locking to [`type-test-authoring`](../type-test-authoring/SKILL.md).
- For runtime behavior coverage of boundary handlers/controllers, route test implementation to [`typescript-api-test-generator`](../../agents/typescript-api-test-generator.agent.md).

## Validation

- Run targeted tests for valid and invalid boundary inputs.
- Verify invalid payloads produce the expected failure shape: field errors, result-object errors, or thrown boundary errors that match the repository's convention.
- Re-run typecheck after deriving or re-exporting the validated type.
- Confirm consumers no longer rely on unvalidated `unknown` or ad hoc casts.
- Keep [`references/boundary-validation-scenarios.md`](references/boundary-validation-scenarios.md) in sync when the repo's error-handling convention, schema library, or transport-to-domain boundary changes.

## Examples

- `Before`
  ```ts
  const payload: User = JSON.parse(raw);
  ```
  `After`
  ```ts
  const payload = UserSchema.parse(JSON.parse(raw));
  ```
- `Failure shape` (custom result wrapper when callers branch on success or failure)
  ```ts
  {
    ok: false,
    errors: [
      { path: ['body', 'email'], message: 'Invalid email address' },
    ],
  }
  ```
- `Before`
  ```ts
  export function readConfig(value: any) { return value.mode; }
  ```
  `After`
  ```ts
  export function readConfig(value: unknown) {
    return ConfigSchema.parse(value).mode;
  }
  ```
