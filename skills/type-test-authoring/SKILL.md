# Type test authoring

## Use this skill when

- The user wants to protect generic helpers, utility types, or public APIs with compile-time tests.
- A type inference bug or regression should be locked down with a dedicated test.
- The repository already uses a type-test approach such as `tsd`, `dtslint`, `expectTypeOf`, or `@ts-expect-error` fixtures.
- The type contract is important enough to justify introducing the repository's first small compile-time type-test pattern.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is only about runtime behavior and not static type contracts.
- The repository has no meaningful type-test workflow and a normal unit test is more appropriate.
- The change only needs a quick local code sample instead of a maintained regression test.

## Inputs to gather

**Required before editing**

- The public type surface or helper that needs protection.
- The repository's existing type-test tool or convention, if any.
- The positive and negative cases that should stay stable.
- The command used to run the relevant type tests or typecheck fixtures.

**Helpful if present**

- Existing helper assertions such as `expectTypeOf`, `expectAssignable`, or `@ts-expect-error` fixtures.
- Prior bugs that should become regression cases.
- Runtime tests that already cover the same API behavior.

## First move

1. Read the nearest existing type test and match its tool and style.
2. If no type tests exist yet, inspect the repository for an already-installed type-test tool and otherwise start with the lightest existing TypeScript fixture pattern, such as `@ts-expect-error` in dedicated typecheck files.
3. Identify the exact inference or assignability contract that needs protection.
4. Add one positive and one negative case before broadening coverage.

## Workflow

1. Encode the expected inference or assignability behavior using the repository's current type-test tool, or the lightest new pattern justified by the repository's existing tooling.
2. Add negative cases that fail for the right reason, such as `@ts-expect-error` or explicit non-assignability checks.
3. Keep runtime logic minimal so the test stays about types, not behavior.
4. Prefer small focused assertions over giant fixture files.
5. Add a regression case for the bug or edge case that motivated the work.
6. Run the repository's type-test or fixture command and confirm both positive and negative cases behave as intended.

## Guardrails

- **Must not** use type tests as a substitute for runtime tests when runtime behavior changed.
- **Must not** add `@ts-ignore` where a negative assertion should use `@ts-expect-error` or an existing helper.
- **Should** match the repository's current type-test tool instead of introducing a new one casually.
- **Should** keep tests focused on exported or intentionally shared types.
- **May** use compact helper aliases when the repository already has them.

## Validation

- Run the existing type-test command or the nearest equivalent fixture-based typecheck.
- Confirm negative cases fail for the intended reason rather than from unrelated compiler noise.
- Re-run adjacent runtime tests when the same API surface also changed at runtime.

## Examples

- `expectTypeOf`
  ```ts
  expectTypeOf(parseUser({ id: 1 })).toEqualTypeOf<User>();
  // @ts-expect-error wrong shape
  parseUser({ id: "1" });
  ```
- `@ts-expect-error` fixture
  ```ts
  acceptsString("ok");
  // @ts-expect-error numbers are rejected
  acceptsString(123);
  ```
